# CompPhys2
Simplistic 2D monte carlo protein folding project for the Computational Physics lecture @ TU Braunschweig

This project implements a simple monte-carlo time evolution of a 2D-protein initialised as a self-avoiding random walk on a 2D grid.

Peptide interaction contributions to the total energy are determined by randomly generated normal-distributed interaction matrix elements.

Routines for plotting and anmation are provided.

The jupyter notebook (to do) was meant for the in-class presentation of results and nicely demonstrates the implemented functionalities.

Required packages are among others:
- Python 3.10
- Numba 0.56
- Matplotlib, numpy, scipy
